                        <strong>Local Storage</strong> <br>
                        It is a web storage method that helps us store data on the clientâ€™s computer in the form of key/value pairs in a web
                        browser. The data is stored in local storage for a lifetime unless the user manually deletes it from the browser. It
                        does not expire even when the user closes the window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser until and unless
                        the browser's memory is cleared.
                        <br>
                        It's data in the browser can only be accessed via JavaScript and HTML5. However, the user also could clear the browser
                        data/cache to erase all local storage data. It has four methods that we can use to set, retrieve, remove and clear
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Session Storage</strong>
                        <br>
                        It is very similar to the local storage. Still, the main difference lies in the lifespan as it persists in the browser
                        until its current tab is on. Once you close the tab or terminate it, the data on session storage also gets lost. We can
                        also set and retrieve its data using setItem() and getItem() methods, respectively, similar to the local storage
                        methods. For example:
                        <br><br>
                        
                        sessionStorage.setItem(key, value);
                        <br>
                        sessioinStorage.getItem(key);

                    <div class="accordion-body"><strong> Global scope</strong> <br>
                    When a variable is globally scoped, it means it is available from anywhere in your program. Declaring a variable outside
                    a function or a block outside a function leads to it being globally scoped.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Local scope</strong>
                    <br>
                    When variables are declared within a function or a block, they are locally scoped. It means that they can only be
                    accessed inside the function or the block they were declared in.
                    <br>
                    
                    Local scope variables are divided into:
                    <br>
                    Function scoped variables: <br> A function scoped variable means that the variable defined within a function will not
                    accessible from outside the function.
                    <br><br>
                    Block scoped variables: <br>A block scoped variable means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible
                    from outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a block scoped variable will not be available outside
                    the block even if the block is inside a function.

                    <div class="accordion-body">We often hear that JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language, which means it executes all of the instructions
                    line by line in a synchronous manner. Thus since everything works on the main thread, there seems to be no possibility
                    of executing parallel processes in JavaScript.<br><br>
                    
                    But now let's assume that we have a function which is taking some time to execute, for example in the below function
                    which is having a loop over 10k times, the console.log() would be executed once the loop is over and in the meantime,
                    our UI interaction with the browser would be interrupted.<br><br>

                        The above scenario seems to be impractical, but there might be cases where any function can take an indeterminate amount
                    of time and our main thread would be blocked, for example calling an API for fetching data from the server-side. And
                    this is the practical use case we are dealing with in development every day. So how JavaScript handles this and where
                    does the event loop come into the picture? We will surely get to know this, but before moving further, let's understand
                    the basic memory architecture in JavaScript.
